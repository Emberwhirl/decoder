% DECODER is an integrated framework which performs de novo deconvolution, and compartment weight estimation for a single sample.
% This is a walkthrough of executing the Matlab functions.

%% Integrated mode for PC %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% (one-step; easy to run; time-consuming targeting subtle signals with large repetitions for training) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% (good for hypothesis generation and exploration stage) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Set path to where the output files are supposed to reside as working directory

% Prepare a data matrix file with format .mat, .tsv or .csv in the working directory. Refer to demo_data.mat/tsv/csv.
%%% Normalzed counts (TPM/FPKM) for RNAseq and normalized intensities for ATACseq are highly recommended.

% Prepare a "configFile", which is a configuration file that provides input files and auguments in the working directory. Refer to config_de_novo.tsv.
%%% dataType: RNAseq | ATACseq | Microarray
%%% dataMatrix:		(e.g.) demo_data.mat
%%% dataFormat:		(e.g.) mat
%%% geneIDType:		TCGA | geneSymbol | EntrezID
%%% logTransformed:	no | yes (note: if the data is log-transformed)
%%% rangeK:		auto | (e.g.) 2:10 (note: to save time, highly recommend to try 2:10 before the user is sure the data is more complex; larger maximun K tends to capture more subtle signals (less dominant compartments); 'auto' was used for TCGA RNAseq, Moffit microarray and TCGA ATACseq; for 'auto', K starts when the median score is > 0.5, it will run to K=30 at maximun, but stops when the factors are determined to be too splitted before it reaches K=30)
%%% repTimes:		(e.g.) 500 (note: to save time, highly recommend to try 500 before the user wants to finalize robust compartment and gene weights; smaller repTimes tends to give fewer compartments)

% run de novo deconvolution

>> Decon_de_novo(configFile)

% Note: It took ~2 hours for a dataset with 150 samples using repTimes=500 and rangeK=2:10 (TCGA_RNAseq_PAAD). At this setting, one of the interested but easy to miss compartments is absent. When using repTimes=10000 and rangeK=auto, all the interested compartments showed up. As repTimes=10000 is too much for a PC, it is recommended to run on a cluster illustrated as below. 

%% Parallele mode for HPC  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% (two-step; require knowledge of Linux and available cluster system; time-efficient) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% (good for further mining and finalizing stage) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Prepare a data matrix file with format .mat, .tsv or .csv in the working directory. Refer to demo_data.mat/tsv/csv.
%%% Normalzed counts (TPM/FPKM) for RNAseq and normalized intensities for ATACseq are highly recommended.

% Prepare a "configFile", which is a configuration file that provides input files and auguments in the working directory. Refer to config_de_novo_parmode.tsv.
%%% dataType: RNAseq | ATACseq | Microarray
%%% dataMatrix:		(e.g.) demo_data.mat (note: provide absolute path)
%%% dataFormat:		(e.g.) mat
%%% geneIDType:		TCGA | geneSymbol | EntrezID
%%% logTransformed:	no | yes (note: if the data is log-transformed)
%%% repTimes:		(e.g.) 10000 (note: 10,000 was used in the original paper to derive robust weigths)
%%% binDECODER		(e.g.) /nas/longleaf/home/xlpeng/scripts/DECODER (note: provide absolute path to where the DECODER repo is)

% run separate runs for increasing K using a loop
% the wrapped launch file might be different based on the settings of available HPC to users. Refer to launch_sbatch.sh and launch_DECODER_K7.m as an example for UNC longleaf cluster.
% this step generate separate files of xx-factor_data.mat and ccmat_repxxx_fxx.mat
% on terminal

for m in /nas/longleaf/home/xlpeng/scratch/DECODER_demo/launch_DECODER_K*.m
do dir=`dirname $m`
	cd $dir
	sbatch launch_sbatch.sh $m

% after all the jobs are finished
% collect intermediate results from increasing K and process (using matlab)
